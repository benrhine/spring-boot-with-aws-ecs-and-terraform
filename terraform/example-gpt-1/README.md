# Example GPT 1 (EC2)

This example was generated by ChatGPT and edited for the purposes of this tutorial. *THIS IS NOT A PRODUCTION LEVEL
EXAMPLE!!!* This example is about the simplest possible to get a container deployed to ECS.

This example is deployed to EC2 instances on ECS and uses `bridge` networking mode.

*Note: This example does not use a load balancer*

## Quickstart

### Deploy

* `terraform init`
  * With multiple examples in this repo this should be run every time you change examples
* `terraform validate`
* `terraform plan`
* `terraform apply -auto-approve`

### Test

To get the ip address to see if nginx resolves after deploying

Navigate to ECS > Clusters > Select Cluster > Click Tasks Tab > Click on Task > copy public ip > paste into browser

### Destroy / Cleanup

* `terraform destroy -auto-approve`

## Things that are the same across examples

* `provider.tf` is exactly the same for example-1, example-gpt-1, example-gpt-2, example-gpt-3,
* `terraform.tf` is exactly the same for example-1, example-gpt-1, example-gpt-2, example-gpt-3,
* `utils.tf` is exactly the same for example-1, example-gpt-1, example-gpt-2, example-gpt-3,
* `data.tf` is exactly the same for example-1, example-gpt-1, example-gpt-2, example-gpt-3,
* `ecs.tf` is exactly the same for example-1, example-gpt-1, example-gpt-2, example-gpt-3,
* `iam.tf` is exactly the same for example-1, example-gpt-1, example-gpt-2, example-gpt-3,

## Things that are similar

* `vpc.tf` is the same as example-gpt-2
  * Everything in this file is also included in example-1 and example-gpt-3 but there are additional components
* `security-group.tf` has the same configuration in example-1, example-gpt-1, example-gpt-2


## Things that are different

* This is a super basic example and does not include a load balancer
